                <p>Poor people do not have enough clothing, food, education and health care. To be poor means to be
                    deprived economically, politically and socially. They rarely get a chance. They have inadequate
                    nutrition, a higher risk of disease, and a lack of access to healthcare and basic necessities for
                    survival resulting in less achievement. That's why we should help them to survive.
